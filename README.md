# MenuBar Using HTML,CSS


A Menu Bar using HTML and CSS is a horizontal or vertical navigation interface that allows users to move through different sections of a website. 
  It's typically made up of a list of links, each representing a page or a category.

In HTML, the menu bar is structured using an unordered list and list items, while CSS is used to style it, providing design elements like colors, spacing, hover effects, and layout. CSS can also help make the menu bar responsive, ensuring it looks good on various screen sizes, like on mobile or desktop.

Menu bars are often a critical component of web design, ensuring that navigation is intuitive and user-friendly.
